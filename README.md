Coming up with the idea of an automatic tracking system of training progress, this project was built to send email reminders to persons who have not completed training tasks so the Training and HR Team do not need to keep track manually anymore.

A Python system maintains the backend while the frontend is Typescript. Overall, this is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

The product has several details that need to be enhanced since it is just standing at the fundamental stage. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Developer Information
- The backend is in port 8000. Call `python -m uvicorn backend.api:app --reload --port 8000` to start the FastAPI server.
- Recommend to run server in virtual environment: 
    + Create venv (if you have not already): `python -m venv .venv`
    + Fully Activate: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
